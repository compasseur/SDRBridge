/**
 * <h1>HackRF USB Library for Android</h1>
 *
 * Module:      RfSourceCallbackInterface
 * Description: This Interface declares a callback method to return a
 * 				HackRF instance to the application after it was opened
 * 				by the initialization routine (asynchronous process
 * 				because it includes requesting the USB permissions)
